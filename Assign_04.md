Social Network Services and Automated Contents Recommendation
---

Now is a decade of social networking. Many pure social networking services like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. has been launched and grew successful from 2000s. The largest social networking service, Facebook, has launched in 2004 and currently [holds over 2 billion users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/264810/number-of-monthly-active-facebook-users-worldwide/). Also, many Internet service providers are adopting social network features into their original services. For example, YouTube, which originally started as a simple video-sharing platform, has adopted new features like [live streaming, channel-dependent communities, and instant messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube#User_features). One important note is that social network services are being adopted to the field that seems rarely related with traditional SNS, thus creating some issues. For a famous example in korea, SKT developement team has been criticized for [abusing GitHub's star system](http://www.ddaily.co.kr/news/article/?no=184103).

One important feature of social network services is an automated contents recommendation. Most of social network services provide algorithmic method to recommend new contents for users, which is specifically selected based on their actions or taste. For example, Twitter provides recommendation of their contents based on the user's action of viewing or searching other Twitter contents. (https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tailored-suggestions). Automated contents recommendation has become important feature for both users and providers: users can consume more contents that satisfy their needs, and providers can attract users and advertisers to increase their benefits. Automated contents recommendation feature comes in many different forms; most of current SNS provides friend suggestion and timeline feature, which is the result of recommendation.

Homophily in Social Network and Recommendation Algorithm
---

Researches are studying phenomenon in SNS based on network theories, because as the name says, social network is primary structure that goverens these services. [Homophily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophily) is an important concept in the network theory, which means a tendency among similar entities to have closer connection compared to thoses that are not similar. Many studies have already discovered homophily inside a social network. For example, [a study](https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/64/2/317/4085994) has shown that there is strong community formed between Democrats and Republican users of Twitter, which is an evidence political homophily inside Twitter. This study refers to the term "echo chamber" to illustrate homophilic phenomenon inside Twitter. By following users of similar political interest, a user will only get tweets from the same community, and therefore become more biased toward their political position.

It is natural for any social networks, including off-line networks, to have homophilic tendency. Statistically, humans are more likely to make relationship within the communities that they belong. Also, having similar background and interest is an important factor for human to make deeper relationships. However, unlike real-life relationships, social network services have a special method to increase homophilic tendency, which is automated contents recommendation. Recommendation algorithms of social network services find next recommendation based on the user's previous actions. For instance, Facebook suggests a new friend user, which has significantly many common friends with the user. In this process, the users are driven unconsciously to trap inside their own community, which is already composed of simlar background and interests.

Homophily leads Radicalization

[A senior Twitter executive](https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/12/twitter-exec-social-network-content-contributes-radicalization-9915031/) mentioned that social media, including Twitter itself, is contributing to radicalization of the users. She also mentioned that 1.6 million accounts are banned because of terror-related tweets. It is undeniable fact that redicalization phenomenon exist in social network services. More serious problem is that echo chamber phenomenon accelerates radicalization, by forming closed society of similar interest and block contents with opposing opinions. It is more fearful that radicalization occurs slowly without distinctive evidence while users are continuously exposed to recommended contents and forms strong ties within the community.

The radicalization problem already exists in current social networks. A student was canceled from Havard admission because of [racist tweet](https://www.bbc.com/korean/news-48633554). Even though the account had over 300 thousand followers, its racist tweet was not restrained before Havard took an action. Including this example, SNS has already pointed out as a cause of radicalization problem like racism, political and gender discrimination, and terrorism. With automated contents recommendation drives the echo chamber phenomenon, SNS cannot be free of radicalization and its problem

Automated Contents Recommendation is Making people more Radical
---

I agree that social networking and automated contents recommendation are making people more radical. As studies and example show, it is a general fact shown by studies and examples that homophily exists inside social networking services, and drives radicalization phenomenon of its users. It is more dangerous because not only radicalization causes actual problems, but also radicalization progresses naturally and unnoticeably. Automated contents recommendation is an important factor contributing to acceleration of homophily, thus pointed out as a primiary cause of radicalizaition inside SNS.

Another important problems is that sevice providers does not invest special effort to revent the radicalization inside their social networks. It is true that the providers block some extreme and problematic account and contents, but they do not provide an essential way to prevent users from trapeed inside their own homophilic network. Moreover, the providers make use of recommendation algorithm to show more advertisement to the users, regardless of the radicalization caused by the content of advertisement. It is their nature to maximize economical profit by providing suitable contents that users will continue viewing without turning over. This is another primary reason that SNS drives homophily and radicalization process between specific groups of users.

It is true that radicalization in SNS cannot be instantly prevented today. Because radicalization slowly alters users' minds, SNS users must be aware of the fact that recommended contents leads themselves into more closed and radical community inside the whole social network.
