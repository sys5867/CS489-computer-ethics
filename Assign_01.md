## What is Ethics

It is the fundamental question of meta-ethics. In study of meta-ethics, numerous philosophers tried to find nature of moral judgements. In fact, every problems that ethics deal with is closely related with meta-ethics, because every moral decision is related with the definition and range of moral decision. In conclusion, I'd like to borrow concepts from major meta-ethical theories to discuss my personal perspective on Ethics.

## God is dead

It is a famous quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher of the 19th century. By the quote, Nietzsche claimed the loss of universal perspective. This means that there are no absolute truth or reality. Instead, every truth or value depends on perspectives that they are subject of. Because I'm personally interested in how Nitzsche changed modern humanity, I'd like to refer to him as resresentative of revolution in modern moral philosophy.

Nietzsche 'killed' God in a sense that Christian truth and laws, which governed human society before, ended in non-existence in the 19th century. He stated that human will fall into nihilism without universal standard that leads humanity. Without God, people will also lose moral standards, which was previously stated and forced by religious rules. In this sense, perspectivism not only inspired moral skeptism, but also hugely influenced meta-ethics and ethics itself. After Nietzsche, ethical theoriest had to find nature of ethics without any universal laws or standards. Without universal rules, they had difficulties in justifying the root of ethical judgement. As a result, moral skeptism became one of the most major view in meta-ethical theories.

## Dual Inheritance Theory in Rescue

Then, where should human find root of their moral decisions? Is ethics a meaningless thing, if people's moral standards are easily deniable in different circumstance and perspectives? Why human need to make moral decisions? Here, science tries to rescue desperate meta-ethical theorists.

Natural selection is a magical concept. Darwin first suggested the concept based on his observation on various species. This revolutionary idea not only influenced modern biology, but also various other fields. In a branch of human and social study, scientists try to explain human and social behavior by selection theory. Dual inheritance theory claims that current human behavior is a result of cultural evolution, which acts simultaneously and similarly with genetic evolution.

Meta-ethics can get a help from this concept, by claiming that ethical standards are naturally arose in process of gene-cultural coevolution. Moral decision of human is a result of selection and adaptation of human behavior. Then meta-ethical theorists would like to state 'pseudo-universal' moral standards can be derived from ultimate result of human species' evolution. This seems hopeful, because nature of ethics is based on scientific theory, which seems univeral and truthful.

## Science is not the Truth

When I first learned ethical view of dual inheritance theory in the class, it seemed very trustworthy that moral theory can base on scientific theory, therefore can derive universal truth. However, As I
