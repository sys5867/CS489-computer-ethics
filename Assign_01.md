## What is Ethics

It is the fundamental question of meta-ethics. In study of meta-ethics, numerous philosophers tried to find nature of moral judgements. In fact, every problems that ethics deal with is closely related with meta-ethics, because every moral decision is related with the definition and range of moral decision. In conclusion, I'd like to borrow concepts from major meta-ethical theories to discuss my personal perspective on Ethics.

## God is dead

It is a famous quote from Friedrich Nietzsche, philosopher of the 19th century. By the quote, Nietzsche claimed the loss of universal perspective. This means that there are no absolute truth or reality. Instead, every truth or value depends on perspectives that they are subject of. Because I'm personally interested in how Nitzsche changed modern humanity, I'd like to refer to him as resresentative of revolution in modern moral philosophy.

Nietzsche 'killed' God in a sense that Christian truth and laws, which governed human society before, ended in non-existence in the 19th century. He stated that human will fall into nihilism without universal standard that leads humanity. Without God, people will also lose moral standards, which was previously stated and forced by religious rules. In this sense, perspectivism not only inspired moral skepticism, but also hugely influenced meta-ethics and ethics itself. After Nietzsche, ethical theoriest had to find nature of ethics without any universal laws or standards. Without universal rules, they had difficulties in justifying the root of ethical judgement. As a result, moral skepticism became one of the most major view in meta-ethical theories.

## Dual Inheritance Theory in Rescue

Then, where should human find root of their moral decisions? Is ethics a meaningless thing, if people's moral standards are easily deniable in different circumstance and perspectives? Why human need to make moral decisions? Here, science tries to rescue desperate meta-ethical theorists.

Natural selection is a magical concept. Darwin first suggested the concept based on his observation on various species. This revolutionary idea not only influenced modern biology, but also various other fields. In a branch of human and social study, scientists try to explain human and social behavior by selection theory. Dual inheritance theory claims that current human behavior is a result of cultural evolution, which acts simultaneously and similarly with genetic evolution.

Meta-ethics can get a help from this concept, by claiming that ethical standards are naturally arose in process of gene-cultural coevolution. Moral decision of human is a result of selection and adaptation of human behavior. Then meta-ethical theorists would like to state 'pseudo-universal' moral standards can be derived from ultimate result of human species' evolution. This seems hopeful, because nature of ethics is based on scientific theory, which seems univeral and truthful.

## Science is not the Universal Truth

When I first learned ethical view of dual inheritance theory in class, it seemed very trustworthy that moral theory can base on scientific theory, therefore can derive an universal truth, or anythihng looks like universal. However, it started to seem dangerous while I pondered about it. For example, Nazi German's racial policy was theoretically based on eugenics, which claims that genetically inferior individuals must be excluded to improve humanity. In a narrow perspective of selection, eugenics is true. But in a humanity-level view, eugenics cannot and should not be accepted as a truth.

I think dual inheritance theory also has same problem, from a view that scientific theories can be another perspective, but cannot be a foundation for meta-ethical theories. Science is not universal law in its nature. Instead, it is a collection of contemporary paradigms about logical explanation. Science always change and develop related to its circumstances. So even if it's true that scientific theories such as DIT can be a starting point for searching nature of ethics, it should not be assumed that moral decisions can completely base on scientific theories.

It all circles back to moral skepticism. David Hume stated, the rule of morality are non conclusions of our reason, because morals excite passions and behaviors without reason. In this meta-ethical view, nature of ethics should be considered as cause, not a consequence.

## What is My Own Ethics?

In the end, I came to a conclusion that moral skepticism explains the nature of ethics the most. Although it does not provide answers to ultimate root of morality, it can inspire humanity that ethics will continue to change and evolve together with humanity. Dual inheritance theory gives similar answer to the meta-ethics; if culture is an unit of selective process, then moral decisions should base on the circumstances which humanity is faces, which is continously-changing culture. In conclusion, I think ethics is study of moral decisions, which its standards are different in circumstances and therefore studying various ethical environment and theories is more important than deriving universal law of ethics.

As science and engineering student, we should be not only fluent in speaking scientific languages, but also be aware of the idea that ethics change on perspectives. We cannot measure moral standards as like we do in labs. Instead, we should always recalibrate moral standards in our profound minds to match evolution of human society surrounding ourselves. Science is one of the most powerful tool in modern society. Exercising its power should be accompanied by understanding on our own moral decisions.
